Jovita… I didn’t fall in love with you, I walked into it knowing every risk and still choosing you. You are my peace, my madness, my forever. Even on silent days, my heart only speaks your name ❤️

No matter how many fights we face, how many tears fall, I promise to hold your hand through everything. Loving you is the easiest decision I’ve ever made. You are my home, my heartbeat, my soul 😘

If I had a thousand lives, I’d find you in every one. You’re not just my girlfriend… you are my universe, my safe place, my always 💞
